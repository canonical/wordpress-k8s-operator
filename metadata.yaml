  A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operators) deploying and managing
  WordPress on Kubernetes. [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) is the world's most popular website
  builder, and it's free and open-source.

  This charm simplifies initial deployment and operations of WordPress on Kubernetes, including scaling
  the number of instances, integration with SSO, access to OpenStack Swift object storage for redundant
  file storage, and more. It allows for deployment on many different Kubernetes platforms, from
  [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io/) to [Charmed Kubernetes](https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes) to public
  cloud Kubernetes offerings.

  This charm will make operating WordPress straightforward for DevOps or SRE teams through Juju's clean
  interface. It will allow deployment into multiple environments to test changes and support scaling out
  for enterprise deployments.
