# How to upgrade WordPress Charm

Before updating the Charm you need to backup the database using MySQL charm's `create-backup` action.

```
juju run mysql/leader create-backup
```
Additional info can be found about backup in [the MySQL documentation](https://charmhub.io/mysql/docs/h-create-and-list-backups)

Then you can upgrade the WordPress Charm.

```
juju refresh wordpress-k8s
```

After upgrading the WordPress Charm you need to update the database schema.

```
juju run wordpress-k8s/0 update-database
```
