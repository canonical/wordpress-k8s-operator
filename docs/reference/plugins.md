# Plugins

By default, the following WordPress plugins are installed with the latest version during the OCI
image build time. If the plugins are installed during runtime with
`juju config wordpress-k8s plugins=<plugin-slug>`, the plugin will also be installed to its latest
version by default and may cause version differences between pods.
The wordpress-k8s charm supports multi-unit deployments. Therefore, installing plugins through UI
has been disabled and can only be installed through the plugins configuration. Please see
[Configurations](https://charmhub.io/wordpress-k8s/configure) section for more
information.
