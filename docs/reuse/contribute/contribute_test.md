This project uses `tox` for managing test environments. There are some pre-configured environments
that can be used for linting and formatting code when you're preparing contributions to the charm:

* ``tox``: Executes all of the basic checks and tests (``lint``, ``unit``, ``static``, and ``coverage-report``).
* ``tox -e fmt``: Runs formatting using ``ruff``.
* ``tox -e lint``: Runs a range of static code analysis to check the code.
* ``tox -e static``: Runs other checks such as ``bandit`` for security issues.
* ``tox -e unit``: Runs the unit tests.
* ``tox -e integration``: Runs the integration tests.
