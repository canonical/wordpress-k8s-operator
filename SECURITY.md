# Security policy

## What qualifies as a security issue

Credentials leakage, outdated dependencies with known vulnerabilities, and
other issues that could lead to unprivileged or unauthorised access to the
database or the system.

## Reporting a vulnerability

The easiest way to report a security issue is through GitHub.
See [Privately reporting a security
vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
for instructions.

The repository admins will be notified of the issue and will work with you
to determine whether the issue qualifies as a security issue and, if so, in
which component. We will then handle figuring out a fix, getting a CVE
assigned and coordinating the release of the fix.

The [Ubuntu Security disclosure and embargo policy](https://ubuntu.com/security/disclosure-policy)
contains more information about what you can expect when you contact us, and what we
expect from you.
