# How to contribute

```{note}
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/canonical/wordpress-k8s-operator/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for information on contributing to the source code.
```

Our documentation is stored in the `docs` directory alongside the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/canonical/wordpress-k8s-operator/).
It is based on the {ref}`Canonical starter pack <starter-pack>`
and hosted on [Read the Docs](https://about.readthedocs.com/). In structuring,
the documentation employs the [Di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr/) approach.

You may open a pull request with your documentation changes, or you can
[file a bug](https://github.com/canonical/wordpress-k8s-operator/issues) to provide constructive feedback or suggestions.

For syntax help and guidelines,
refer to the
{ref}`Canonical MyST style guide <starter-pack:myst_style_guide>`.

To run the documentation locally before submitting your changes:

```bash
make run
```

## Automatic checks

GitHub runs automatic checks on the documentation
to verify spelling, validate links and style guide compliance.

You can (and should) run the same checks locally:

```bash
make spelling
make linkcheck
make vale
```
